# aylo-ecommerce

This is a MERN stack mock ecommerce site wherein the user can create an account. They can select the shoes that they want and add it to their bag or to their wishlist. Once they add it on their bag, they can checkout using Stipe payment method. They can also see a receipt once the payment is successful. They can also edit their account details, see their order history, and change the order status to "Delivered" (available only if the status is "Shipped", only the admin can ship the order/s). 

It has also an admin panel (for me only) where I can edit a product details, ship orders, add new product, and add new admin account. It has also a dashboard where I can see all the orders, users, products, and some analytics.

For the Frontend: React, Redux, Styled Components.

For the Backend: JWT, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, Firebase Storage.

This ecommerce site is hosted at Heroku: https://aylo-official.herokuapp.com/
